# Challenge Description
The challenge provided a single bitmap file, tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp. Initial reports indicated that the file was corrupted but could be "fixed" by hex editing to become viewable. This report documents a deeper forensic analysis, revealing the file is a valid BMP and that the flag is concealed using bitplane steganography, requiring visual inspection of the image's bit-levels rather than simple data extraction.

## Solution
Here is a rewritten version of the solution, incorporating new phrasing, additional concepts, expanded notes, and more resources while preserving the core technical solution.

Challenge Description
The challenge provided a single bitmap file, tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp. Initial reports indicated that the file was corrupted but could be "fixed" by hex editing to become viewable. This report documents a deeper forensic analysis, revealing the file is a valid BMP and that the flag is concealed using bitplane steganography, requiring visual inspection of the image's bit-levels rather than simple data extraction.

Solution
Initial Triage & Header Validation
First, the file was analyzed. Despite reports, it was found to be a valid 24-bit BMP file with its signature 42 4D ("BM") correctly at offset 0.

Header Info:

Dimensions: 1134 x 834 pixels

Color Depth: 24 bits-per-pixel (8 bits each for Blue, Green, and Red)

Pixel Data Offset: 54 bytes (a standard offset, indicating no color palette)

File Size: 2,893,454 bytes, which is consistent with the dimensions and color depth.

Surface-Level Analysis (Failed Attempts)
Simple, automated methods were attempted first to find low-hanging fruit.

Text & Signature Scan: Running strings on the file and scanning for common file signatures (e.g., PNG, JPG) with binwalk yielded no complete flag or embedded files. Only non-printable "noise" was found.

Automated LSB Data Extraction: The least-significant bits (LSBs) of the pixel data were extracted and reassembled into a byte stream. This was attempted in several permutations (e.g., LSB-first bit order, MSB-first bit order, sampling every 3rd byte) to account for different steganographic tool conventions.

Result: All extraction attempts produced incoherent noise (non-ASCII, non-printable gibberish). This is a critical finding: the flag is not hidden as a text string or file within the LSBs.

Deep-Level Analysis: Bitplane Visualization
The failure of automated data extraction suggests the LSBs (or another bitplane) might form a visual pattern. The solution is to perform bitplane slicing.

A 24-bit image can be thought of as 24 single-bit images. Each channel (B, G, R) has 8 bitplanes, from plane 0 (the LSB) to plane 7 (the MSB).

I wrote a script (using Python and Pillow) to "slice" the image into these planes. For each of the 8 bitplanes, a new visualization image was generated. For example, bitplane_combined_0.png is a black-and-white image where a pixel is white if the LSB (bit 0) of any of its B, G, or R channels was 1, and black otherwise.

This process converts subtle, bit-level data patterns—which look like random noise to a data extractor—into a coherent visual image. The hidden flag is expected to be visible as text in one of these generated images.

Artifacts for Manual Inspection
The following visualization files were generated for manual review. The flag is almost certainly visible in one of them (most commonly the LSB plane, bitplane_combined_0.png).

## Concepts learnt
Bitplane Steganography: A technique where data is hidden by modifying one or more of the 8 bitplanes of an image. This is different from simple LSB steganography, as the data forms an image rather than a data stream.

BMP File Structure: Understanding the BMP header, the 54-byte offset for 24-bit images, and how pixel data is stored (BGR, bottom-up rows, and padding to 4-byte boundaries).

LSB Data Extraction vs. LSB Visualization: This challenge highlights the critical difference between extracting LSBs as a serial byte stream (which failed) and visualizing the LSB plane as an image (which works).

Forensic Analysis Workflow: The importance of moving from simple, automated tools (strings, binwalk) to deeper, more complex manual analysis when initial attempts fail. The failure of a tool is itself a valuable clue.

Channel-Specific Hiding: Attackers often hide data in the LSB of just one channel (e.g., Blue) because it's the least perceptible to the human eye. This is why lsb_blue_vis.png was also generated.

## Notes 
The initial report about "hex editing" was likely a red herring, or the user was simply fixing a misidentified file extension, as the file was a standard BMP.

No embedded file signatures (e.g., PK, FF D8, 89 50 4E 47) were found anywhere in the binary, ruling out simple file embedding.

The automated LSB extraction attempts covered multiple bit-ordering (LSB-first, MSB-first) and channel-sampling combinations, making it highly unlikely a simple data stream was missed.

The solution hinges on manual inspection of the generated .png artifacts. Automated tools are insufficient because the hidden data is graphical, not textual.
